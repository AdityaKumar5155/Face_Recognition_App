Welcome to Face_Recognition_App,
This app is a very close replica of the program used in
Guvi Guiness Book of World Records.

Note:- This App needs atleast 1GB free space for 
       Proper working. As it stores large amount of
       Data to function.

Working:-

Step-1 : When you will launch this program. It will
         Ask you to enter number of different scenes 
         you want to capture.
         For Example :- If you want to detect that
         is the person in front of camera weares mask
         Or not then you enter 3, then in first
         Run it will capture your background and in
         next run it will capture you without mask and
         In third run, it will capture you with mask.

Note:- Make sure you were not in front of camera while 
       program captures background. While capturing
       your face without mask, you should not wear
       mask. And while capturing with mask you should
       wear mask. By the way, you can also it for more
       Purpose like rock, paper, scissors, etc by 
       entering 4. So, it will record first background
       then, rock , paper and scissors.(Make sure only
       your hand is visible while capturing rock, paper
       And scissors)

Step-2 : Now, as you will enter your desired number of 
         Scenes. It will immediately start capturing
         Background. After capturing background camera
         Will pause and program will ask you to press
         Enter for next scene. And so on until all 
         Scenes captured. Once everything captured. It
         Will start training(Memory Error could be 
         Occured dur to unavailability to RAM in your
         device.)

Step-3 : Once training will completed, only you have to
         do is press enter. And it will immediately start
         camera and start predicting the current scene 
         using the data he got while training.
         For Example :- For first Scene(Background)
         It will print 0, for second scene(without mask)
         it will print 1, and so on. To stop the program
         press 'q' on keyboard.

I want you to try this program and suggest me if I can
do some changes in it. If you want to report some changes
Just create a issue for this repository.
